___

***Week 2***

Further exploration of clock ideas lead me to a concept in which a geometric "spirograph-like" graphic could be drawn as time progresses. There could be either; multiple different spirographs to represent different units of time; or a single spirograph that, for example, completes segments every minute and a whole rotation every hour.


- Completed `maeda_clock.js`
